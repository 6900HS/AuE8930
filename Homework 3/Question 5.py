# Question 5 (5â€™)
# 
# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
# 
# An input string is valid if:
# 
# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# 
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# 
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
